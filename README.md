# QIC
Term paper assignment for PYL749: Quantum information and computing course at IIT Delhi
The title of the paper followed is "Calculation of Ï€ on the IBM quantum computer and the
accuracy of one-qubit operations" 
According to the paper we have started with a single qbit system and rotated it by $$\pi/2$$ and $$3*\pi/2$$ then difference in the space of these 2 bits is taken as phase difference is $$\pi$$ now. The paper was published in 2020.

The project containes 2 files one is a tutorial file self-made so I don't have to go to qiskit documentation repeatdily and another file is the term paper one which realises the value of pi using IBM's cloud machine that allows to use some qbits on their hardware.
